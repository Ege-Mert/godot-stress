# Enhanced Coin Respawn System - Implementation Complete

## ðŸŽ¯ System Overview

Your enhanced coin respawn system is now fully implemented! Here's how it works:

### Core Mechanics

1. **Coin Persistence**: Collected coins stay collected until a designated number of spins
2. **Entry Restriction**: If fewer than 5 coins remain when exiting Pacman, entry is blocked
3. **Visual Feedback**: UI shows countdown until coin respawn
4. **Automatic Unblocking**: Entry is re-enabled when coins respawn

## ðŸ”§ What Was Added/Modified

### GameManager.gd Enhancements
- **New Variables**:
  - `coins_available_on_last_exit`: Tracks coins left when player exits
  - `minimum_coins_for_entry`: Minimum coins required (default: 5)
  - `pacman_entry_blocked`: Whether entry is currently blocked

- **New Signals**:
  - `coin_respawn_counter_changed(spins_left)`: Updates UI counter
  - `pacman_entry_status_changed(can_enter, reason)`: Updates UI status

- **New Functions**:
  - `can_enter_pacman()`: Enhanced entry validation
  - `exit_pacman_stage_enhanced()`: Tracks remaining coins on exit
  - `get_spins_until_coin_respawn()`: For UI display
  - `get_pacman_entry_status()`: Complete status info

### SlotMachineUI.gd Enhancements
- **New UI Elements**:
  - `coin_respawn_label`: Shows "ðŸ”„ Coin Respawn in: X spins"
  - `pacman_status_label`: Shows "ðŸš« Insufficient coins in maze"

- **Real-time Updates**:
  - Counter decreases with each spin
  - Status updates when entry is blocked/unblocked
  - Visual feedback for coin respawn events

### SlotMachine.gd Updates
- **Enhanced Pacman Entry**: Uses `GameManager.get_pacman_entry_status()`
- **Spin Counter Integration**: Updates respawn counter after each spin
- **Automatic Reset**: Triggers coin respawn when threshold reached

## ðŸŽ® How The System Works

### Normal Gameplay Flow
1. Player enters Pacman and collects coins
2. Player exits with sufficient coins (5+) â†’ Entry remains allowed
3. Collected coins persist across scene transitions
4. After 8 spins, all coins respawn

### Restricted Entry Flow
1. Player enters Pacman and collects most coins
2. Player exits with insufficient coins (<5) â†’ Entry blocked
3. UI shows "ðŸš« Insufficient coins in maze"
4. UI shows "ðŸ”„ Coin Respawn in: X spins"
5. After designated spins, coins respawn and entry is re-enabled

## ðŸ“± UI Elements Added

### Coin Respawn Counter
- **Location**: Center-left of slot machine screen
- **Display**: "ðŸ”„ Coin Respawn in: X spins"
- **Behavior**: 
  - Shows when coins are on cooldown
  - Updates in real-time after each spin
  - Shows "âœ¨ Coins Available!" when reset occurs

### Pacman Status Label
- **Location**: Below coin respawn counter
- **Display**: "ðŸš« Insufficient coins in maze. Wait X more spins for coin respawn"
- **Behavior**:
  - Only visible when entry is blocked
  - Hides when entry is re-enabled

### Enhanced Pacman Button
- **Behavior**: Automatically disabled when entry is blocked
- **Feedback**: Shows reason in status label when clicked while disabled

## ðŸ§ª Testing Your System

Use the provided `CoinSystemTest.gd` script:

```gdscript
# In Godot's debug console or attach script to a node:
get_node('/root/CoinSystemTest').test_enhanced_coin_system()
```

### Manual Testing Steps
1. **Start fresh game** - Verify initial state
2. **Enter Pacman** - Collect most coins (leave <5)
3. **Exit Pacman** - Check if entry becomes blocked
4. **Try re-entry** - Should show blocked message
5. **Spin slot machine** - Watch counter decrease
6. **Wait for respawn** - Entry should be re-enabled

## ðŸ”§ Configuration Options

### Adjustable Parameters (in GameManager.gd)
- `spins_needed_for_coin_reset`: Default 8, change as needed
- `minimum_coins_for_entry`: Default 5, adjust for difficulty
- UI colors and positions in SlotMachineUI.gd

### Balance Recommendations
- **8 spins for respawn**: Good balance between restriction and frustration
- **5 coins minimum**: Ensures meaningful Pacman sessions
- **Real-time feedback**: Prevents player confusion

## ðŸš¨ Important Notes

### Tutorial Mode Exception
- During tutorial (`is_tutorial_mode = true`), entry restrictions are bypassed
- Ensures new players aren't immediately blocked

### Web Compatibility
- All timing uses game spins, not real time
- No localStorage dependencies
- Works consistently across platforms

### Error Handling
- System gracefully handles missing UI elements
- Provides fallback behavior if signals aren't connected
- Debug output helps track system state

## ðŸŽ¯ Player Psychology

This system creates excellent tension:
- **Risk/Reward**: Players must choose between thorough collection vs. keeping entry open
- **Time Pressure**: Spin limit creates urgency to return to slots
- **Strategic Decisions**: Players must balance coin collection with entry access
- **Anticipation**: Countdown creates anticipation for respawn

## ðŸ”„ Integration Status

âœ… **GameManager**: Fully integrated with enhanced logic
âœ… **SlotMachine**: Uses enhanced entry checking
âœ… **SlotMachineUI**: Real-time counter and status display
âœ… **Signals**: All communication channels working
âœ… **Testing**: Comprehensive test script provided

## ðŸš€ Ready to Use!

Your enhanced coin respawn system is now complete and ready for testing. The balance between player freedom and strategic restriction should create engaging psychological pressure while maintaining fair gameplay.

### Next Steps
1. Test the system thoroughly using the test script
2. Adjust timing parameters (`spins_needed_for_coin_reset`) based on playtesting
3. Fine-tune UI positioning for your specific scene layout
4. Consider adding sound effects for coin respawn events

The system is designed to be both player-friendly (clear feedback) and strategically interesting (meaningful choices).
