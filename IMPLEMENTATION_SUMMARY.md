# Core Game Loop Improvements - Implementation Summary

## âœ… COMPLETED FIXES

### 1. Random Seed Issue (Web) - FIXED
- Updated both `SlotMachine.gd` and `GameManager.gd` with improved web-safe seeding
- Uses multiple entropy sources (time + object hash) for better randomization on web platforms
- Added logging to verify seed values

### 2. Coin Persistence System - IMPLEMENTED
- Added persistent coin tracking in GameManager
- Coins now stay collected until player completes configurable number of spins (default: 8)
- New functions: `register_coin_position()`, `collect_coin_at_position()`, `is_coin_collected()`
- Updated PacmanCoinManager to use persistence system
- Coins automatically respawn when reset triggers

### 3. Manual Pacman Entry - ADDED
- Added "ENTER MAZE" button to slot machine UI (shows after tutorial)
- Players can enter Pacman stage anytime with at least 1 coin
- Button is disabled during tutorial mode
- Connected through new `pacman_button_pressed` signal

### 4. Improved Ghost AI - CREATED
- New `ImprovedGhostAI.gd` script with smarter behavior
- Three AI states: Wandering, Chasing, Cornering
- Grid-based movement with collision detection
- Dynamic difficulty based on player distance
- Ready to replace existing ghost scripts

### 5. Upgrade System Overhaul - COMPLETED
**Old Upgrades Removed:**
- `better_odds` (unclear benefit)
- `coin_multiplier` (too generic)
- `reduced_cost` (made game too easy)
- `invincibility` (broke game balance)
- `coin_magnetism` (automatic, no skill)

**New Slot Machine Upgrades:**
- `win_frequency`: +8% win chance per level (Cost: 60 coins)
- `payout_boost`: +30% coin payout, +20% debt reduction per level (Cost: 120 coins)
- `lucky_spin`: +2% chance per level for bonus features (Cost: 200 coins)

**New Pacman Upgrades:**
- `movement_speed`: +30 speed per level (Cost: 40 coins)
- `coin_radar`: Shows coin locations (Cost: 80 coins) - *Ready for implementation*
- `ghost_slowdown`: Slows down ghosts (Cost: 150 coins) - *Ready for implementation*

### 6. Enhanced Spin Results - IMPLEMENTED
- Added "lucky spin" mechanic with visual feedback
- New result types: `lucky_coin_win`, `lucky_debt_win`
- Better payout balancing (100-300 debt reduction vs old 50-200)
- Improved multiplier system

## ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT NOTES

### Tilemap Errors
The tilemap errors you're seeing are likely due to:
1. Atlas sources trying to create tiles outside texture bounds
2. Corrupted tileset configuration
3. Missing tile alternatives

**Quick Fix:** Open your PacmanScene, select the TileMapLayer, and check the TileSet resource. You may need to recreate the problematic atlas sources.

### Files That Need Scene Updates
Since we added new functionality, you'll need to update these scenes:

1. **SlotMachine.tscn**: Add a "PacmanButton" to the BottomPanel
2. **UpgradeShop.tscn**: Update upgrade buttons to match new upgrade names
3. **Ghost scenes**: Replace old ghost scripts with `ImprovedGhostAI.gd`

## ðŸŽ¯ IMMEDIATE TESTING NEEDED

1. **Test coin persistence**: 
   - Collect some coins in Pacman
   - Return to slot machine
   - Do several spins
   - Check if coins respawn after 8 spins

2. **Test manual Pacman entry**:
   - Click "ENTER MAZE" button after tutorial
   - Verify it only works with 1+ coins

3. **Test new upgrades**:
   - Buy `win_frequency` upgrade
   - Verify increased win rate
   - Test `lucky_spin` for bonus features

## ðŸ”§ NEXT STEPS

1. **Add PacmanButton to UI scene**
2. **Update UpgradeShop scene** with new upgrade names
3. **Implement coin_radar** visualization in Pacman scene
4. **Implement ghost_slowdown** effect in ghost manager
5. **Fix tilemap errors** by checking atlas configurations
6. **Test thoroughly** in both desktop and web builds

## ðŸŽ® NEW GAMEPLAY FLOW

1. Player starts with tutorial (rigged first spin)
2. After tutorial: Player can spin OR enter Pacman manually
3. Coins persist across scene transitions
4. Upgrades provide meaningful strategic choices
5. Coin reset every 8 spins creates timing decisions
6. Lucky spins add excitement and unpredictability

Your core game loop is now much more player-friendly while maintaining the psychological pressure that makes the game compelling!
