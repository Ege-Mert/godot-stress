# üéÆ GAME JAM FIXES APPLIED - TESTING GUIDE

## ‚úÖ Critical Fixes Applied:

### 1. **Main Scene Optimization** 
- **Changed**: project.godot now directly loads SlotMachine.tscn
- **Benefit**: Removes unnecessary redirect, faster startup
- **Test**: Game should start directly in slot machine

### 2. **Audio Crash Prevention**
- **Fixed**: All audio node references now have null checks
- **Files modified**: SlotMachine.gd, PacmanScene.gd  
- **Benefit**: Game won't crash if audio files are missing
- **Test**: Game should run even without audio files

### 3. **Reel Animation Performance**
- **Optimized**: Simplified reel animation system
- **Added**: Frame rate monitoring and adaptive updates
- **Benefit**: Smoother gameplay, less lag during spins
- **Test**: Slot machine should spin smoothly at 60fps

### 4. **Resource Loading Safety**
- **Enhanced**: Better texture loading with existence checks
- **Benefit**: Handles missing sprite files gracefully
- **Test**: Game works even with missing sprite assets

## üß™ How to Test Your Fixes:

### Quick Test (2 minutes):
1. **Start Game**: Should load directly to slot machine
2. **Spin Once**: Should work without crashes
3. **Check Console**: Look for warning messages, not errors
4. **Transition**: Try getting broke to go to Pacman scene

### Detailed Test (5 minutes):
1. **Slot Machine Testing**:
   - Multiple spins in a row
   - Check for smooth reel animation
   - Verify audio plays (or warnings if missing)
   - Test handle drag and button spin

2. **Scene Transition Testing**:
   - Get broke (spend all coins)
   - Verify transition to Pacman
   - Check player movement works
   - Test coin collection

3. **Performance Testing**:
   - Spin multiple times rapidly
   - Check FPS counter (should stay near 60)
   - Look for frame drops during animation

## üö® Known Issues Still Present:

1. **Audio Files Missing**: Game shows warnings but continues
2. **Wall-Phasing Ghost**: May need scene testing to verify detection
3. **Upgrade Shop**: Might need additional testing

## üéØ Priority if Issues Found:

1. **If game crashes**: Check console for error messages
2. **If audio doesn't work**: This is expected (just warnings now)
3. **If performance is poor**: Check if FPS adaptive system is working
4. **If scenes don't load**: Verify scene file paths are correct

## üìù Debug Commands (if needed):

Add this to any scene for testing:
```gdscript
# Add DebugHelper.gd script to a node to run automated tests
var debug = preload("res://Scripts/DebugHelper.gd").new()
add_child(debug)
```

## üèÅ Game Jam Ready Checklist:

- ‚úÖ Game starts without crashes
- ‚úÖ Basic slot machine functionality works  
- ‚úÖ Scene transitions work
- ‚úÖ Player movement works
- ‚úÖ Coin collection works
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Audio (optional - warnings only)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è All sprites loaded (fallback text if missing)

## üöÄ Quick Emergency Fixes (if needed):

If you find issues during the jam:

1. **Game crashes on start**: 
   - Check project.godot main scene path
   - Verify SlotMachine.tscn exists

2. **Performance issues**:
   - Increase FPS threshold in SlotMachine.gd line 260
   - Reduce reel animation complexity further

3. **Scene loading fails**:
   - Use absolute paths: get_tree().change_scene_to_file("res://...")
   - Check scene file names match exactly

Your game should now be stable enough for the game jam! The stress theme is well-implemented through the debt mechanics and the escalating ghost difficulty. Good luck! üé≤
