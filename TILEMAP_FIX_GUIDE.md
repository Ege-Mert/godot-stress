# TILEMAP ERROR FIX INSTRUCTIONS

## The Problem
Your tilemap errors are caused by invalid TileSetAtlasSource configurations in your PacmanScene.tscn.

The errors show:
- "Cannot create tile. The tile is outside the texture"
- "The TileSetAtlasSource atlas has no tile at (1, 0)"

## How to Fix

### Method 1: Quick Fix in Godot Editor
1. Open `PacmanScene.tscn`
2. Select the `TileMapLayer` node
3. In the Inspector, find the `TileSet` resource
4. Click on the TileSet resource to open it
5. Look for any atlas sources with red error indicators
6. For each problematic atlas source:
   - Check the texture_region_size matches your actual tile size
   - Verify that the atlas coordinates don't exceed the texture bounds
   - Remove any tiles marked as invalid

### Method 2: Recreate TileSet (Recommended)
1. Create a new TileSet resource
2. Add your tile textures one by one
3. Carefully configure each atlas source:
   - Set correct texture_region_size (probably 32x32)
   - Only create tiles that exist within the texture
4. Replace the old TileSet with the new one

### Method 3: Manual Scene Fix
If the scene file is corrupted, you may need to:
1. Create a new empty scene
2. Add your nodes manually
3. Place your coins and other objects again
4. Use a properly configured TileSet

## Prevention
- Always check that your tile textures are properly sized
- Don't manually edit .tscn files for TileSet data
- Use the Godot editor's TileSet tools

## Quick Test
After fixing, you should be able to:
1. Open PacmanScene.tscn without errors
2. Run the scene without tilemap warnings
3. Transition from SlotMachine to PacmanScene smoothly
