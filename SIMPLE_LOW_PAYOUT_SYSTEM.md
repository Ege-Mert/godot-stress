# Simple Ultra-Low Payout System\n\n## Overview\nThe slot machine now works exactly like a normal slot machine - when symbols match, you win. The difficulty comes from drastically reduced payout amounts that are configurable from the GameManager inspector.\n\n## How It Works\n\n### Normal Slot Machine Behavior\n- **2+ matching symbols = Win** (standard slot machine rules)\n- **No matching symbols = Loss**\n- **3 jackpot symbols = Jackpot**\n\n### Ultra-Low Payouts\nThe GameManager inspector settings control the payout amounts:\n\n#### Current Settings:\n- **Coin Wins**: 3-8 coins (down from 10-30)\n- **Debt Reduction**: $25-75 (down from $100-300)\n- **Jackpot**: Clears all debt OR fixed $1M amount\n\n#### Original vs New Payouts:\n| Win Type | Original | New | Reduction |\n|----------|----------|-----|----------|\n| Coin Win | 10-30 | 3-8 | ~75% less |\n| Debt Win | $100-300 | $25-75 | ~75% less |\n| Jackpot | $1M | All debt | Variable |\n\n## GameManager Inspector Settings\n\n### Payout Ranges (Configurable)\n- **Min Coin Win**: `3` - Minimum coins awarded\n- **Max Coin Win**: `8` - Maximum coins awarded  \n- **Min Debt Reduction**: `25` - Minimum debt reduction\n- **Max Debt Reduction**: `75` - Maximum debt reduction\n- **Lucky Multiplier**: `1.5x` - Multiplier for lucky wins (if implemented)\n- **Upgrade Payout Boost**: `0.1` - Boost per upgrade level (if implemented)\n\n### Jackpot Settings\n- **Jackpot Clears All Debt**: `true` - Whether jackpot clears all debt\n- **Jackpot Fixed Amount**: `$1,000,000` - Fixed amount if not clearing debt\n\n## Balancing Difficulty\n\n### To Make Even Harder:\n- Reduce `min_coin_win` to `1`\n- Reduce `max_coin_win` to `5`\n- Reduce `min_debt_reduction` to `10`\n- Reduce `max_debt_reduction` to `50`\n- Set `jackpot_clears_all_debt` to `false`\n\n### To Make Slightly Easier:\n- Increase `max_coin_win` to `12`\n- Increase `max_debt_reduction` to `100`\n- Keep jackpot clearing all debt\n\n## Example Outcomes\n\n### Cherry Win:\n```\nSymbols: [Cherry, Cherry, Bell]\nResult: 3-8 coins (random within range)\n```\n\n### Diamond Debt Win:\n```\nSymbols: [Diamond, Diamond, Seven]\nResult: $25-75 debt reduction (random within range)\n```\n\n### Seven Jackpot:\n```\nSymbols: [Seven, Seven, Seven]\nResult: All debt cleared (or $1M if setting disabled)\n```\n\n## Why This Approach Works\n\n### Advantages:\n✅ **Transparent**: Players see exactly what they get\n✅ **Fair**: Normal slot machine rules apply\n✅ **Brutal**: Tiny payouts make progress extremely slow\n✅ **Configurable**: Easy to adjust difficulty from inspector\n✅ **No Cheating Suspicion**: Players can't claim it's rigged\n\n### The Psychology:\n- Players win frequently enough to stay engaged\n- But winnings are so small they barely make progress\n- Creates a \"death by a thousand cuts\" feeling\n- Debt seems impossible to overcome\n- Players keep thinking \"just one more spin\"\n\n## Technical Implementation\n\nThe `calculate_result_from_symbols()` function now:\n1. Counts symbol matches normally\n2. Awards wins for 2+ matches\n3. Uses GameManager payout ranges instead of symbol-defined amounts\n4. Maintains all visual effects and highlighting\n\nNo artificial manipulation, no forced losses, no complex probability systems - just a normal slot machine with painfully small rewards.\n
